# Development guide

This guide covers the normal steps for making a code change.

## Before you start

Follow [Getting started](./getting-started.md) first. Make sure `pnpm dev` starts without an error.

Create a Git branch for your work:

```bash
git switch -c short-name-for-change
```

Use a short name that explains the change, such as `fix-menu-price` or `add-event-filter`.

## Setting up your user account

### With Feide

Before you can test features that require login, you need to add your account. This is done through
a small script that creates an invite for you email address, which allows you to log in through
Feide. Run the script with your email address:

```bash
pnpm run add-invitation "<your uib email>"
```

You can then navigate to the login page and log in with your Feide account.

> You UiB email address should be the one that ends with `@student.uib.no`. This is usally the email
> that we get from Feide when you authenticate.

### Without Feide

When the app is running in development mode, navigate to `/logg-inn` and enter `board` in the email
field. The app creates a generic board member if it does not exist, signs you in immediately, and
reuses the same user on later logins. This shortcut is not available in production.

Development logins are configured in `DEV_USERS` in
`programmerbar-web/src/routes/(app)/logg-inn/+page.server.ts`. Add another entry there to make more
development users available; account creation, restoration, role assignment, and login are handled
by the shared `handleDevLogin` function.

## Becoming a board member

To become a board member and gain administrator privileges on the site after you have logged in, you
need to run the following script:

```bash
pnpm run add-board "<your uib email>"
```

## Finding the right place to work

Start from the page or feature you want to change:

- Page or form: look in `programmerbar-web/src/routes`.
- Reusable UI: look in `programmerbar-web/src/lib/components`.
- Database work: look in `programmerbar-web/src/lib/server/db`.
- Business rules and database queries: look in `programmerbar-web/src/lib/server/services`.
- Sanity content: look in `programmerbar-cms/schemaTypes` and `programmerbar-web/src/lib/api/sanity`.
- Email design: look in `programmerbar-email-templates/emails`.

It is usually easier to find a similar feature and follow its pattern than to start from an empty
file.

## Working with server code

Server routes receive shared services through `locals`. The services are created in
`src/hooks.server.ts` and live in `src/lib/server/services`.

Before adding a new query directly to a route, check whether the matching service already has the
method you need. If several routes will use the new logic, the service is normally the best place
for it.

## Forms and input

Treat all form values as untrusted. A user can change values before sending them to the server.
Validate input with Zod before saving or using it.

A common shape looks like this:

```typescript
const formSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(1),
  email: z.email(),
});

const result = formSchema.safeParse(values);

if (!result.success) {
  // Return a useful error to the form.
}
```

Look at existing `+page.server.ts` files for the full form pattern used in this project.

## Checking your work

Run these from the repository root:

```bash
pnpm check
pnpm lint
pnpm format:check
```

- `check` finds TypeScript and Svelte errors.
- `lint` finds unsafe or confusing code patterns.
- `format:check` checks spacing and formatting.

To let Prettier fix formatting, run:

```bash
pnpm format
```

Build the full project when your change affects setup, packages, or production code:

```bash
pnpm build
```

## Before opening a pull request

Check that:

- The feature works in the browser.
- Error cases show a useful message.
- `pnpm check`, `pnpm lint`, and `pnpm format:check` pass.
- You added or updated tests when it makes sense.
- You did not commit `.env` or any secret values.
- You updated the docs if setup or behavior changed.
- A database schema change includes a generated migration.

Keep pull requests focused on one change when possible. This makes them easier for another student
to read, test, and review.
